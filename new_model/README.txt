This folder contains three folders:

    - "model": This folder contains the first runs of training a model using MACE with the dataset "251017_training_data.xyz".
                "training_notebook" is a jupyter notebook used to perform the training and "funciones" is a .py file with the
                functions used to plot results.
                The "reults" folder contains the .txt files with the information of the resulting model.
                The "test_res" folder contains the .xyz files that result from a validation test using the resulting model
    
    - "model_01": This folder contains the second set of runs of training a model using MACE with the dataset
                "251030_training_data_lt_0eV.xyz".
                "training_notebook" is a jupyter notebook used to perform the training and "funciones" is a .py file with the
                functions used to plot results.
                The "results" folder contains the .txt files with the information of the resulting model.
                The "test_res" folder contains the .xyz files that result from a validation test using the resulting model, and
                the .xlsx file with the comparison of the predicted energies with the reference energies.
                The "img_res" folder contains the graphs of the training loss and validation loss

    - "model_02": This folder contains the third set of runs of training a model using MACE with the dataset
                "251030_training_data_lt_2eV.xyz".
                "training_notebook" is a jupyter notebook used to perform the training and "funciones" is a .py file with the
                functions used to plot results.
                The "results" folder contains the .txt files with the information of the resulting model.

                The "img_res" folder contains the graphs of the training loss and validation loss
    
    - "model_03": This folder contains the first run of training a model using MACe with the dataset "Fe_Si_B_1118.xyz"
                "training_notebook" is a jupyter notebook used to perform the training and "funciones" is a .py file with the
                functions used to plot results.
